Contributing Code
------------------
- Please fork the repo and add your code to a feature branch, and open a PR against this repo
- You will notice this repo follows a non-standard style convention. We respect the original PyAlgoTrade conventions
    - camelCaseVariables and methodNames
    - liberal use of __fullyPrivateVariables and getPrivateVariable() and setPrivateVariable()
    - prolific use of abstract class interfaces, base classes and implementation classes that hide their base

If you have any questions on style conventions please open an issue! We are happy to discuss and begin building a style guide document.
